# Hi there, I'm Ryan! 👋

I'm a Mechanical Engineer who recently switched gears (no pun intended) into software and cloud computing. I'm also a former Air Force Engineering Officer who had the pleasure of serving in the Royal Canadian Air Force. As a result I fell in love with all things tech as well as aviation and aerospace.

I used to think "tech" was only about building fancy cars, rockets, and machines. That's why I decided to pursue the physical side of things by studying mechanical engineering. I soon realized how incomplete this mindset was. There is a whole new world to be explored when it comes to the intangible side of things - aka software and the virtual world. In some ways this is analogous to the world of thought. It seems much of the innovation in today's day and age happens in this domain (Apps, Code, Cloud, Digital, etc).

With this realization in mind, I decided to upskill, evolve and transition into this brave new landscape of the Digital World. And that is why you found me today, on this GitHub page. Welcome! My current focus, within the digital landscape, is in Cloud Computing. Why? The cloud, for me, is a foundational level technology that allows the creation of other technologies. Much like a well established city that allows entrepreneurs, newcomers, and passionate dreamers to move in and set up shop. The cloud for me is the same. It is also a technology where I can see myself learning and contributing to for a very long time.  

As I have recently begun my journey, my portfolio and projects are still a work in progress. But that doesn't mean I am not growing. A wise teacher once taught me "Slow is Smooth, and Smooth is Fast". So here I am. Taking things slowly and smoothly. What exactly am I doing? I am currently learning and developing skills in the cloud, particularly on AWS, with a special interest in Solutions Architecture. I am creating hands-on projects, authoring technical articles and developing tutorials to showcase my understanding and passion for this exciting new field. 

## Below are some of my recent projects:

- Deploying a Furniture Website Using Terraform. [Link](https://github.com/ryan-almeida/terraform-concepts-project)
- Building a Serverless Image Processing App. [Link](https://github.com/ryan-almeida/image-processing-app)
- Building a Multi-Container Voting Application. [Link](https://github.com/ryan-almeida/container-app)
- Building a Todo Web Notification Servic. [Link](https://github.com/ryan-almeida/todo-web-service)
- Building a Food Ordering Chatbot. [Link](https://github.com/ryan-almeida/chatbot-app)
- Building an Airport Statistics Dashboard Using QuickSight. [Link](https://github.com/ryan-almeida/quicksight-bi)
- Building a Turn Based Game and Learning Event Driven Architecture. [Link](https://github.com/ryan-almeida/turn-based-game)
- Building a Bookstore Application using AWS Databases. [Link](https://github.com/ryan-almeida/database-project)

If you ever feel like collaborating, contributing, or working together (because isn't that what it's all about?), here are few more things about me and my professional background:

## Knowledgeable in: 
- ☁️ AWS
- 💠 Git/GitHub
- 🐧 Linux, BASH
- 🐍 Python
- 🏗 Terraform
- ∞ CI/CD pipelines
- 🐳 Docker
- JIRA/Confluence

## Mechanical Engineering Skills that translate to Tech: 
- ✔️ Learning how to learn (biggest asset of a STEM education)
- ✔️ Advanced quantitative and critical thinking skills
- ✔️ Ability to define a problem, measure, evaluate, verify assumptions and propose solution using scientific methods  
- ✔️ Ability to reverse-engineer products and solutions to understand unfamiliar concepts
- ✔️ Manufacturing, Assembly Line, and Computer Aided Design experience that is easily translatable to virtual counterpart (Agile Methodology, Change Management, Stakeholder Engagement, Supply Chain, Testing and Troubleshooting, Cost Management, Prototyping, Technical Documentation and more)

## Military Skills that translate to Tech:
- ✔️Extreme attention to detail
- ✔️Ability to remain calm in stressful situations
- ✔️Ability to adapt and overcome obstacles in the face on constantly changing priorities
